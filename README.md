# Tutorials

## Python tutorials

* Main CatBoost tutorial with base features demonstration:
    * __kaggle_titanic_catboost_demo.ipynb__ 
        * This tutorial shows how to train a model on Titanic kaggle dataset. Examples of cross validation, parameter tunning and overfitting detection are provided.
    * __catboost_base_functions.ipynb__
        * This tutorial shows different usages of CatBoost including training with custom error function, using different classes for training, using weights and others.

* CatBoost perfomance at different competition: 
    * __kaggle_paribas.ipynb__ 
        * This tutorial shows how to get to a 9th place on paribas competition with only few lines of code and training a CatBoost model. 

    * __mlbootcamp_v_tutorial.ipynb__
        * This is an actual 7th place solution by Mikhail Pershin. Solution is very simple and is based on CatBoost.

    * __sberbank\_catboost\_example\_robust\_.ipynb__ 
        * This tutorial is another example of using CatBoost on a kaggle machine learning competition. 

* CatBoost and Tensorflow:
    * __quora_catboost_w2v.ipynb__ 
        * This tutorial shows how to use CatBoost together with Tensorflow if you have text as input data.

* CatBoost and CoreML:
    * __catboost_coreml_export_tutorial.ipynb__ 
        * This tutorial shows how to convert CatBoost model to CoreML format and use it on an iPhone.

## R tutorials

* Main CatBoost tutorial with base features demonstration:
    * __catboost\_r\_tutorial.\*__
         * This tutorial shows how to train a model on Titanic dataset. Examples of cross validation and parameter tunning.
